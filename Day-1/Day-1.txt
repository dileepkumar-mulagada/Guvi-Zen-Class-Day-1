1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1 (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

    * It is work on Textual format.
    * It operates on a single request-response mechanism,that each request creates a new connection. 
      This can lead to slower loading times.
    * It compresses data by itself.
    * It usees request resources inlinging for getting multiple pages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTTP2.0 (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

    * It works on binary protocol.
    * It allows multiplexing, So one TCP connection is required for multiple requsts
    * It uses HPACK for data compression.
    * It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.



2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

    In JavaScript, Object is a data structure that allows you to store and organize data. 
    Objects consist of key-value pairs, where each key is a string and each value can be any data type. 
    Objects are a fundamental part of the language and are used extensively in various scenarios.

    Understanding the internal workings of JavaScript objects unveils the magic that propels the 
    language's prowess in handling diverse data scenarios. So, next time you manipulate objects in the
    JavaScript, remember, there's a hash table dance happening beneath the surface.
